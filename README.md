# OBGYN-department-website
 <small>This website is responsive (bootstrap 3)</small><br>
 There are three different login modes: admin, doctor, or patient. <br>
 Patients can book their appointments and view their past appointments where they can view the notes their doctor had left them. <br>
 Doctors can view their own past or upcoming appointments, and leave comments for their patients. They can also view the department's inventory in order to book devices for their appointments. <br>
 Admins are already registered in the database so they login without signing up. They can view all past or upcoming appointments for all doctors, and also all the booked and available devices in the inventory.<br>
